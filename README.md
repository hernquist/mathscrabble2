# math-scrabble 2

Proud to annoucnce math-scrabble 2. 
In this version you can play against the computer. The computer is pretty good, but beatable.

I know my code is hopelessly sloppy. It is poorly organized. Math-scrabble is the first thing outside of a for loop I ever built. 
Mathscrabble 2 is built on top of the initial version, and I hadn't planned on a computer play version. That being said, I could use a lot of the functionality of the version when I set out to have the computer make moves. That was kind of cool. 
I didn't know objects in the first go-around, so I added that. I didn't know simple methods like .splice so I ended up doing some crazy stuff with the tiles, which we were double arrays. 

Anyway, here it is, sloppy and fun!
