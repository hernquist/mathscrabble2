# math-scrabble

Math scrabble comes from a childhood inspiration. My sister and I used to play a game like it growing up. She delighted in destroying me in our matches. It was a good motivation for me to learn my multiples.

This game is prototype or MVP for my next version. I did make this version with the next in my mind and I am excited to see if my design strategy will hold out.

Math-scrabble 1.0                              
One tile placement per turn                                                                          
To score a row or column must                      
be a multiple ff 5.

Random tiles                                     
For a tile to be placed,                         
both column OR row sums have to be a multiple    
of 5. 

Static number of tiles that is                  
diminishing each turn.                          

Game ends when all tiles are played.          
                                                
Math-scrabble 2.0
Multiple tile placement like in the real scrabble game. Include endturn button

A user (or student) can choose from different multiples to play

Random tiles, although 5's will be less common.

For a tile to be placed, both column AND row sums have to be 
a multiple of 5 (or for whatever multiple is being used). 

Tiles are replaced after being used. Game length is decided by a total
number of tiles that are in a "pile", just like in a real scrabble game.
  
Game ends when no more tiles can be placed. Remaining tile values are 
subtracted from a player's score.
